  Abstract                 = {Context: Self-Driving cars are getting more and more attention with public demonstration from all important automotive OEMs but also from companies, which do not have a long history in the automotive industry. Fostered by large international competitions in the last decade, several automotive OEMs have already announced to bring this technology to the market around 2020. Objective: International competitions like the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge did not focus on efficient usage of resources to realize the self-driving vehicular functionality. Since the automotive industry is very cost-sensitive, realizing reliable and robust self- driving functionality is challenging when expensive and sophisticated sensors mounted very visibly on the vehicle's roof for example cannot be used. Therefore, the goal for this study is to investigate how architectural design decisions of recent self-driving vehicular technology consider resource-efficiency. Method: In a multiple case study, the architectural design decisions derived for resource- constrained self-driving miniature cars for the international competition CaroloCup are compared with architectural designs from recent real-scale self-driving cars. Results: Scaling down available resources for realizing self-driving vehicular technol- ogy puts additional constraints on the architectural design; especially reusability of software components in platform-independent algorithmic concepts are prevailing. Conclusion: Software frameworks like the robotic operating system (ROS) enable fast prototypical solutions; however, architectural support for resource-constrained devices is limited. Here, architectural design drivers as realized in AUTOSAR are more suitable.},

This especially holds for a project to develop a highly innovative, autonomously driving vehicle to participate in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. In this contribution, we present essential elements of a software and systems engineering process to develop a so-called artificial intelligence capable of driving autonomously in complex urban situations. The process itself includes agile concepts, like a test first approach, continuous integration of all software modules, and a reliable release and configuration management assisted by software tools in integrated development environments. However, one of the most important elements for an efficient and stringent development is the ability to efficiently test the behavior of the developed system in a flexible and modular system simulation for urban situations both interactively and unattendedly. We call this the simulate first approach.},

We applied the containerized software paradigm successfully to both the software development and deployment to turn our software architecture in the vehicles following the idea of microservices. Key enabling elements include onboarding of new developers, both researchers and students, traceable development and packaging, convenient and bare-bone deployment, and traceably archiving binary distributions of our quickly evolving software environment. In this paper, we share our experience from working one year with containerized development and deployment for our self-driving vehicles highlighting our reflections and application-specific shortcomings; our approach uses several components from the widely used Docker ecosystem, but the discussion in this paper generalizes these concepts. We conclude that the growingly complex automotive software systems in combination with their computational platforms should be rather understood as datacenters on wheels to design both, (a) the software development and deployment processes, and (b) the software architecture in such a way to enable continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation.},

  Abstract                 = {The software powering today's vehicles surpasses mechatronics as the dominating engineering challenge due to its fast evolving and innovative nature. In addition, the software and system architecture for upcoming vehicles with automated driving functionality is already processing ~750MB/s - corresponding to over 180 simultaneous 4K-video streams from popular video-on-demand services. Hence, self-driving cars will run so much software to resemble "small data centers on wheels" rather than just transportation vehicles. Continuous Integration, Deployment, and Experimentation have been successfully adopted for software-only products as enabling methodology for feedback-based software development. For example, a popular search engine conducts ~250 experiments each day to improve the software based on its users' behavior. This work investigates design criteria for the software architecture and the corresponding software development and deployment process for complex cyber-physical systems, with the goal of enabling Continuous Experimentation as a way to achieve continuous software evolution. Our research involved reviewing related literature on the topic to extract relevant design requirements. The study is concluded by describing the software development and deployment process and software architecture adopted by our self-driving vehicle laboratory, both based on the extracted criteria.},

Monitoring data from real usage scenarios allows for a number of improvements in the software life-cycle, such as quick identification and solution of issues, and elicitation of requirements from previously unexpected usage. While the processes of continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation using sandboxing technologies are becoming well established in said software-only products, adopting similar practices for the automotive domain is more complex mainly due to real-time and safety constraints. In this paper, we systematically evaluate sandboxed software deployment in the context of a self-driving heavy vehicle that participated in the 2016 Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge (GCDC) in The Netherlands. We measured the system's scheduling precision after deploying applications in four different execution environments. Our results indicate that there is no significant difference in performance and overhead when sandboxed environments are used compared to natively deployed software. Thus, recent trends in software architecting, packaging, and maintenance using microservices encapsulated in sandboxes will help to realize similar software and system engineering for cyber-physical systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe an autonomous robotic software subsystem for managing mission execution and discrete traffic interaction in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. Its role is reviewed in the context of the software system that controls ldquoBossrdquo, Tartan Racingpsilas winning entry in the competition. Design criteria are presented, followed by the application of software design principles to derive an architecture well suited to the rigors of developing complex robotic systems. Combined with a discussion of robust behavioral algorithms, the designpsilas effectiveness is highlighted in its ability to manage complex autonomous driving behaviors while remaining adaptable to the systempsilas evolving capabilities.}

  Abstract                 = {The DARPA Urban Challenge required robotic vehicles to travel more than 90 km through an urban environment without human intervention and included situations such as stop intersections, traffic merges, parking, and roadblocks. Team VictorTango separated the problem into three parts: base vehicle, perception, and planning. A Ford Escape outfitted with a custom drive-by-wire system and computers formed the basis for Odin. Perception used laser scanners, global positioning system, and a priori knowledge to identify obstacles, cars, and roads. Planning relied on a hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture to analyze the situation, select the appropriate behavior, and plan a safe path. All vehicle modules communicated using the JAUS (Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems) standard. The performance of these components in the Urban Challenge is discussed and successes noted. The result of VictorTango’s work was successful completion of the Urban Challenge and a third-place finish.},

After several stages of qualification, our team CarOLO qualified early for the DARPA Urban Challenge Final Event and was among only 11 teams from initially 89 competitors to compete in the final. We had the ability to work together in a large group of experts, each contributing his expertise in his discipline, and significant organizational, financial, and technical support by local sponsors, who helped us to become the best non-U.S. team.
